Welcome to the WMSI Owl Kit Development repository!

Here you can find every sketch ever used on an Owl prototype, as well as some circuit diagrams and files for manufacturing. If you're brand new to the Owls, you'll probably be better off starting with our Comprehensive Owl Guide, which can be found at this link: https://goo.gl/V9kGfm.

If you are looking for example code for a specific Owl application, check out the examples folder. Most of the names in this folder should be self-explanatory, but if you're confused about a particular application look it up in the guide above. The code in this folder is by far the best-commented of any in this repository, but once you work through some examples you should be able to navigate the messier prototype code without too many issues.

In the Fritzing and Eagle folders you'll find material related to the Owl circuit as laid out for a breadboard or PCB. The Fritiing files will probably be most useful for reconstructing or understanding how all the parts of the circuit function. Use the Eagle files if you intend to manufacture a PCB or just love staring at circuit diagrams.

The "code for schools" folder (as the name suggests) contains sketches for specific educational applications. Each sketch should have a long comment at the top explaining what it was built for and what it does.

Only go delving into the "prototype code" folder if you have a firm grasp on all the example code and feel like peeling through layers of old, uncommented, hacked together sketches.
